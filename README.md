SQL Injection (SQLi) remains a top vulnerability in web security, exploiting weaknesses in application-level query handling to enable unauthorized access, data theft, or system manipulation. Existing SQLi detection methods, such as rule-based and single-model machine learning approaches, struggle with evolving attack patterns and often produce high false positives or fail to detect more sophisticated obfuscations. This project proposes a novel hybrid SQLi detection model that combines the unsupervised Isolation Forest Algorithm (IFA) with the supervised Random Forest Algorithm (RFA), paired with TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. The Isolation Forest effectively identifies structural anomalies, flagging potential SQLi attempts, while the Random Forest classifier further refines detection, significantly reducing false positives and false negatives. The TF-IDF vectorizer enhances the modelâ€™s accuracy by efficiently transforming SQL queries into meaningful feature vectors that highlight essential terms and phrases commonly associated with SQLi attacks. This unique approach enables the model to detect complex SQLi patterns with a high degree of accuracy and robustness, making it adaptable to new forms of SQLi attacks.
